Windows Development Environment
-------------------------------
To compile Catlooking for use as a Windows desktop application, you will
need the following:
- Windows XP, Vista, or 7
- A recent version of Qt 4 (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads).  It's easiest to
  get started with a version that comes with the MinGW compiler, since I
  haven't tested the latest code with Visual Studio.  Add both the "bin"
  directory and the "mingw\bin" directory that come with it to your "Path"
  environment variable.

Linux/UNIX Development Environment
----------------------------------
To compile Catlooking for use as a Linux or UNIX desktop application, you
will need the following:
- g++ (any relatively recent version should work)
- A recent version of Qt 4 (including qmake and development headers)
- Other packages as needed to satisfy the above requirements or create
  packages for your OS/distribution
  
Catlooking for Windows Compilation, Packaging
--------------------------------------------
- Open a command prompt, and change to the root directory of the downloaded
  Catlooking source code.  If this isn't at "C:\catlooking", you'll have to
  change the paths for "LIBS" and "INCLUDEPATH" in catlooking.pro.
- From that directory run "packaging\windows\build.bat"; this will generate a
  working catlooking.exe file in the "build" directory.
- If you want to create an installer for Catlooking, first install Inno Setup.
  Then run "packaging\windows\installer.bat"; you may need to edit it first
  in order to adjust the paths to Qt and/or Inno Setup.  This will generate an
  executable installer in the "build/windows" directory.

Debian Package Building
-----------------------
To create a Debian package for the desktop version of Catlooking, from the
root Catlooking source directory run "packaging/linux/debian.sh".  If you have
all the appropriate development packages installed, the .deb file will be
generated in the build/debian directory.

Linux/UNIX compilation
----------------------
- Set the QMAKESPEC and QTDIR environment variables as appropriate for your
  platform
- Run qmake on catlooking.pro
- Run make
