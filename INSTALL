Windows Development Environment
-------------------------------
To compile Catlooking for use as a Windows desktop application, you will
need the following:
- Windows XP, Vista, or 7
- A recent version of Qt 4 (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads).  It's easiest to
  get started with a version that comes with the MinGW compiler, since I
  haven't tested the latest code with Visual Studio.  Add both the "bin"
  directory and the "mingw\bin" directory that come with it to your "Path"
  environment variable.

Linux/UNIX Development Environment
----------------------------------
To compile Catlooking for use as a Linux or UNIX desktop application, you
will need the following:
- g++ (any relatively recent version should work)
- A recent version of Qt 4 (including qmake and development headers)
- Other packages as needed to satisfy the above requirements or create
  packages for your OS/distribution
  
Catlooking for Windows Compilation, Packaging
--------------------------------------------
- Download and install NSIS (http://www.scratchpaper.com/).
- Open "packaging\windows\build-windows.bat", and adjust the path to Qt,
  mingw and NSIS directory.
- Run "packaging\windows\build-windows.bat"; this will generate a
  working executable file and installation script (InstallCatlooking.exe).

Debian Package Building
-----------------------
To create a Debian package for the desktop version of Catlooking, from the
root Catlooking source directory run "packaging/linux/debian.sh".  If you have
all the appropriate development packages installed, the .deb file will be
generated in the build/debian directory.

Linux/UNIX compilation
----------------------
- Set the QMAKESPEC and QTDIR environment variables as appropriate for your
  platform
- Run qmake on catlooking.pro
- Run make
