If you looking for a place to be left alone with your thoughts and write in a peaceful environment, Catlooking is a good start. Unfortunately, it can’t do anything for the kids running and screaming around you...
The new Catlooking has less buttons to give you more place for your inspiration. Text will not disappear if you quit Catlooking. I know that your operation system may crash, so your text saves every 30 seconds. In other words: don’t worry about your text, just be concentrate.
If you are writing at night your screen could be very bright. That's not so good for your eyes. In this case I advice you to switch to the "night" mode. This kind of environment is more suitable for a night time.
And when you finished you can export your text from Catlooking.

I hope you enjoy it.
